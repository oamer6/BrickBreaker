# brickBreaker

The objective of brick breaker is to break the bricks that are distributed around the top of the game screen. The bricks are
destroyed after the ball makes contact with them, awarding 5 points for each brick. At the bottom is a paddle
that is controlled by the user to prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen. In this implementation,
the user will use the right and left arrow keys to control the paddle.
